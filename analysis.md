Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a wallet risk scoring system using Compound V2/V3 on-chain transaction data. The goal is to assign a score between 0 and 1000 to each wallet, representing its risk level.
Due to limited valid API data, the project is divided into two parts: a rule-based scoring model using actual API data (for only a few wallets), and a fallback machine learning model using synthetically generated wallet data.
